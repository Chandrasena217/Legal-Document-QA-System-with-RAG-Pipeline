# Legal Document QA System with RAG Pipeline

### An intelligent Legal Assistant that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer queries based on uploaded legal documents (PDF/TXT). This project combines document parsing, semantic search, and large language models (LLMs) to provide context-aware legal answers, along with document references.

## Problem Statement

Legal professionals often spend excessive time searching through lengthy documents to find specific clauses, precedents, or answers to legal questions. This system aims to automate that process by:

1. Processing various legal document formats (PDFs, text files)
2. Creating a searchable knowledge base
3. Providing accurate answers to natural language questions
4. Citing relevant sources from the documents

## Solution Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that:

- Processes and chunks legal documents
- Creates vector embeddings for semantic search
- Uses a large language model (Mistral-7B) to generate precise answers
- Provides source citations for verification

## Key Features

- **Document Processing**: Handles PDFs and text documents with proper text extraction and cleaning
- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant document chunks using FAISS vector similarity
- **Precise QA**: Generates accurate answers with citations using Mistral-7B
- **API Endpoints**: FastAPI backend for easy integration
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves processed documents for future queries

## ðŸš€ Demo & Capabilities

- Upload legal PDFs or text files.
- Ask legal questions in natural language.
- Receive AI-generated answers grounded in the uploaded documents.
- View sources (document name, page number, similarity score) for transparency.
- REST API built with FastAPI for easy integration.
